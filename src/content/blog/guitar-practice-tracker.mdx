A tracker can be the difference between "I think I'm getting better?" and knowing you're improving. But most people track the wrong thing.

Tracking gives you clarity: what works, what doesn't, and what to try next.

Below is a simple, beginner-friendly system you can use as a guitar practice log (or guitar practice journal) that actually measures progress—without turning practice into a chore.

## Why "minutes practiced" isn't enough

Time is useful, but it lies by omission.

- You can practice 30 minutes half-asleep and barely improve.
- You can practice 10 focused minutes and make a real breakthrough.
- You can practice daily but scatter your attention across 12 things and stall.

> Minutes tell you how long you played. They don't tell you how well you trained.

## The 5 Things Worth Logging

If you only log these five, you'll be ahead of 95% of players who "track" their practice.

### 1. Time (Volume)
Keep it simple (10 min, 35 min). You don't need perfection.
*Why it matters: Time reveals volume. Over weeks, volume predicts results.*

### 2. Focus (Technique)
Pick ONE main focus: alternate picking, rhythm, bending, etc.
*Why it matters: Progress accelerates when practice stops being random.*

### 3. Intensity (Effort)
Rating 1-3. 1=Easy maintenance, 2=Focused, 3=Hard push.
*Why it matters: Explains why two weeks of 'same minutes' yield different results.*

### 4. Consistency (Streak)
Did you practice today? Yes/No. Track your streak.
*Why it matters: Consistency is the engine. Skill is built by repeated exposure.*

### 5. Song Work
If you want real-world results, track what song/section you drilled.
*Why it matters: Technique becomes music only when applied to songs.*

## What Progress Looks Like

### After ~2 weeks
- Practice becomes regular (fewer gaps)
- Focus becomes clearer (less "everything")
- You can name what's improving

### After ~3-4 weeks
- Small skill jumps (cleaner transitions)
- Increasing challenge naturally
- **Biggest sign:** You stop guessing what to practice

## Common Tracking Mistakes

**Tracking too many details**
Fix: Track only the 5 essentials.

**Writing vague notes ('scales', 'song')**
Fix: Be specific: 'Alt picking: 6-note, 80bpm'.

**Mixing ten focuses in one session**
Fix: One main focus per session.

**Only logging 'good days'**
Fix: Log short sessions too. They keep the habit alive.

## Sample Log Template

```text
Date: Jan 1
Time practiced: 30 min
Main focus: rhythm/timing
Intensity (1-3): 2
Consistency: ✅ Practiced / Streak: 5 days
Song work: "Schism" verse riff (slow + clean)
Quick note: timing improved when I counted subdivisions
```

## How Riff Quest Automates This

- **Auto-Time** — Time is captured automatically when you use a timer
- **Skill Focus** — Focus is baked into how you start a session
- **XP & Rewards** — Intensity + consistency boost rewards (XP multipliers)
- **History** — Song work becomes part of your history
