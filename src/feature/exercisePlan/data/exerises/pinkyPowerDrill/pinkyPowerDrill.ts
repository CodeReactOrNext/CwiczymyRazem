  title: "Pinky-Led Patterns",
  description: "Strengthen your weakest finger by making it lead every phrase.",
  difficulty: "medium",
  category: "technique",
  timeInMinutes: 10,
  instructions: [
    "Every pattern starts with the pinky (4th finger) on the highest fret.",
    "Play descending patterns: 4-3-2-1 (pinky-ring-middle-index).",
    "Focus on making the pinky strike with the same power as your index finger.",
    "Keep the pinky curved - a flat pinky is a weak pinky.",
    "Practice patterns where the pinky hammers on or pulls off to build strength.",
    "Move the pattern across all strings and different positions on the neck."
  ],
  tips: [
    "The pinky is naturally weaker because it shares a tendon with the ring finger.",
    "Keep the pinky curved at all times - this engages the proper muscles.",
    "Don't compensate by twisting your wrist - maintain neutral wrist position.",
    "Build strength gradually - forcing it can lead to injury.",
    "Practice pinky trills (rapid hammer/pull-off) to build endurance.",
    "Listen to Django Reinhardt who played incredible lines with only two fingers!"
