  description: "Short explosive chromatic bursts followed by rests. Train your hands to fire fast and reset cleanly.",
  difficulty: "hard",
  category: "technique",
  timeInMinutes: 5,
  instructions: [
    "Each burst is a short explosive sprint — play the notes as fast and clean as you can.",
    "Use the rests to completely relax your hands before the next burst.",
    "Measures 1-3: 4-note bursts on single strings with a full beat of rest between each.",
    "Measures 4-5: 6-note cross-string bursts (3 notes per string, Paul Gilbert style) with a half-beat rest.",
    "The goal is maximum speed during the burst and total relaxation during the rest.",
  ],
  tips: [
    "The rest is just as important as the burst — use it to fully reset tension.",
    "Think of each burst as one explosive gesture, not individual notes.",
    "Relax your picking hand completely between bursts — shake it out if needed.",
    "On cross-string bursts, focus on a seamless string transition with no gap.",
    "If a burst feels sloppy, drop tempo by 20 BPM. Speed without clarity is useless.",
