  title: "Chromatic Spider Drill",
  description: "Build finger independence with chromatic permutation patterns.",
  difficulty: "medium",
  category: "technique",
  timeInMinutes: 5,
  instructions: [
    "Play the pattern 1-2-3-4 (index-middle-ring-pinky) chromatically across all strings.",
    "Each finger gets one fret: 1st finger on fret 5, 2nd on fret 6, 3rd on fret 7, 4th on fret 8.",
    "Keep all fingers hovering close to the strings - don't lift them high.",
    "After completing all 6 strings, shift position and play the reverse pattern 4-3-2-1.",
    "Practice the permutation 1-3-2-4 to challenge weaker finger coordination.",
    "Maintain consistent rhythm and equal volume across all fingers."
  ],
  tips: [
    "Keep your thumb positioned in the middle of the back of the neck for balance.",
    "The pinky (4th finger) will be the weakest - give it extra attention.",
    "Don't tense up - relaxation is key to building endurance.",
    "This is the foundation exercise for all finger independence work.",
    "Start slow enough that every note rings clearly with no buzzing.",
    "Used by virtuosos like John Petrucci and Paul Gilbert for daily warm-ups."
